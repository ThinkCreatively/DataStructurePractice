# DataStructurePractice
Practicing Instantiation Patterns and creating basic data structures:

## Regarding the Instantiation Patterns: 
~ I will be creating queues and stack data structure with three different methods to each of them

### Stacks: <br />
Follow a First In Last Out pattern (FILO) <br />
  #### Methods: <br />
  ~ push: adds a value to the stack <br />
  ~ pop: removes a value from the stack <br />
  ~ size: returns the size of the stack <br />

### Queue:
Follow a First in First Out pattern (FIFO) <br />
  #### Methods: <br />
  ~ enqueue: adds a value to the queue <br />
  ~ dequeue: removes a value from the queue <br />
  ~ size: returns the size of the queue
