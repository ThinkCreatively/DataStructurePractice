/*
~ For all the instantiation patterns I will be creating queues and stack data structure with three different methods to each of them

~ Stacks: Follow a First In Last Out pattern (FILO)
  ~ Methods:
  ~ push: adds a value to the stack
  ~ pop: removes a value from the stack
  ~ size: returns the size of the stack

~ Queue : Follow a First in First Out pattern (FIFO)
  ~ Methods:
  ~ enqueue: adds a value to the queue
  ~ dequeue: removes a value from the queue
  ~ size: returns the size of the queue
